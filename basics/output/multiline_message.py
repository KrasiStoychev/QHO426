#We previously learnt how the print function could be used to display a simple message. Functions can be called multiple times in the code and, on each call , they can be provided a different set of arguments if desired. This means that we can call the print function more than once in our code.

print("system faliure imminet")
print("System reboot has been initiated..")

print("Rebooting sensory system")
print("Rebooting output motors")
